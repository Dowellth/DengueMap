This is a map about Dengue Fever cases in South America. This project goes along with this article here https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/health/dengue-vaccine-brazil.html

The map is a choropleth map that shows the risk level of Dengue fever in each country and the risk factor was determined by the amount of cases in each country. A legened shows which shade means which risk level and the map has a few interactive features such as zoom, drag, and a popup on mouse hover that shows the country name, amount of cases in that country, and the risk level.  There is also a side bar that has information about the outbreak from the New York Times article. I experemted used a bootstrap theme to better equip the map to be viewed on different devices. 

For some other information on the outbreak look here https://www.paho.org/en/news/28-3-2024-paho-calls-collective-action-response-record-increase-dengue-cases-americas#:~:text=While%20dengue%20is%20on%20the,cases%20and%2087%25%20of%20deaths.
